            <h2> History of Music </h2>
            <div class="history">
                <p class="history">
                    The history of music covers the historical development and presence of music from 
                    prehistoric times to present day. Though definitions of music vary wildly throughout 
                    the world, every known culture partakes in it, and music is thus considered a cultural 
                    universal.The origins of music remain highly contentious; commentators often relate it 
                    to the origin of language, with much disagreement surrounding whether music arose before, 
                    after or simultaneously with language. Many other theories exist, having been proposed by 
                    scholars from a wide range of disciplines, though none have achieved wide approval. 
                    Most cultures have their own mythical origins concerning the invention of music, generally 
                    rooted in their respective mythological, religious or philosophical beliefs.
                    <br>
                    The music of prehistoric cultures is first firmly dated to c. 40,000 BP of the Upper Paleolithic 
                    by evidence of bone flutes, though it remains unclear whether or not the actual origins lie in 
                    the earlier Middle Paleolithic period (300,000 to 50,000 BP). There is little known about 
                    prehistoric music, with traces mainly limited to iconographical evidence, as well as some simple 
                    flutes and percussion instruments. However, such evidence indicates that music existed to some 
                    extent in prehistoric societies such as the Xia dynasty and the Indus Valley Civilisation. 
                    Upon the development of writing, the music of literate civilizations—ancient music—was present 
                    in the major Chinese, Egyptian, Greek, Indian, Persian, Mesopotamian and Middle Eastern societies. 
                    It is difficult to make many generalizations about ancient music as a whole, but from what is known 
                    it was often characterized by monophony and improvisation. In ancient song forms, the texts were closely 
                    aligned with music, and though the oldest extant musical notation survives from this period, many texts 
                    survive without their accompanying music, such as the Rigveda and the Shijing Classic of Poetry. The 
                    eventual emergence of the Silk Road and increasing contact between cultures led to the transmission 
                    and exchange of musical ideas, practices and instruments.
                    <br>
                    Historically, religions have often been catalysts for music. The Vedas of Hinduism immensely 
                    influenced Indian classical music, while the Five Classics of Confucianism laid the basis for 
                    subsequent Chinese music. Following the rapid spread of Islam in the 6th century, Islamic music 
                    dominated Persia and the Arab world, and the Islamic Golden Age saw the presence of numerous 
                    important music theorists. Music written for and by the early Christian Church properly inaugurates 
                    the Western classical music tradition,[4] which continues into medieval music where polyphony, staff 
                    notation and nascent forms of many modern instruments developed. In addition to religion, or the 
                    lack thereof, a society's music is influenced by all other aspects of its culture, including social 
                    and economic organization and experience, climate and access to technology. Many cultures have 
                    coupled music with other art forms, such as the Chinese four arts and the medieval quadrivium. 
                    The emotions and ideas that music expresses, the situations in which music is played and listened to, 
                    and the attitudes toward musicians and composers all vary between regions and periods. Many cultures 
                    have or continue to distinguish between art music (or 'classical music'), folk music and more recently, 
                    popular music.

                    "But that music is a language by whose means messages are elaborated, that such messages 
                    can be understood by the many but sent out only by the few, and that it alone among all 
                    language unites the contradictory character of being at once intelligible and 
                    untranslatable—these facts make the creator of music a being like the gods and make music 
                    itself the supreme mystery of human knowledge."
                    <em>Claude Lévi-Strauss, The Raw and the Cooked.</em><br>

                    It remains debated as to what extent the origin of human cognition—and thus music—will 
                    ever be understood, with scholars often taking polarizing positions.The origin of music 
                    is regularly discussed as intrinsically linked with the origin of language, with the nature 
                    of their connection being a subject of serious debate. However, before the mid-late 20th 
                    century, both topics were seldom given substantial attention by scholars. Since recent 
                    resurgence in the topic, the principal source of contention is whether music began as a 
                    type of proto-language and a product of adaptation that led to language, if music is a 
                    spandrel (a phenotypic byproduct of evolution) that was the result of language or if music 
                    and language derived from a common antecedent. A well known take on the second is from 
                    cognitive psychologist and linguist Steven Pinker; in his How the Mind Works (1997), Pinker 
                    famously termed music as merely "auditory cheesecake", an analogy relating to his view of 
                    music as a spandrel, arguing that "as far as biological cause and effect is concerned, 
                    music is useless", and that "it is a technology, not an adaptation". Music psychologist 
                    Sandra Trehub notes that, like Pinker, "much of the larger scientific community is highly 
                    skeptical about links between music and biology", in opposition to specialists on the 
                    subjects. Scholars such as Joseph Carroll and Anna K. Tirovolas have rejected Pinker's 
                    take, citing evolutionary advantages including its use as practice for cognitive flexibility 
                    and "indicating to potential mates [one's] cognitive and physical flexibility and fitness".
                    <br>
                    There is little consensus on any particular theory for the origin of music, which have 
                    included contributions from archaeologists, cognitive scientists, ethnomusicologists, 
                    evolutionary biologists, linguists, neuroscientists, paleoanthropologists, philosophers and 
                    psychologists (developmental and social). Theories on the topic can be differentiated in 
                    two ways: structural models, which see music as an outgrowth of preexisting abilities, and 
                    functional models which consider its emergence as an adaptive technique. Taking the latter 
                    approach is perhaps the first significant theory on the origins of music: Charles Darwin's 
                    1871 book The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, where he briefly proposed 
                    that music was originally an elaborate form of sexual selection, perhaps arising in mating 
                    calls. His theory is difficult to affirm, as there is no evidence that either sex is 
                    "more musical" thus no evidence of sexual dimorphism; there are currently no other examples 
                    of sexual selection that do not include considerable sexual dimorphism. However, citing 
                    music's use in other animals's mating systems, commentators such as Peter J.B. Slater, 
                    Katy Payne, Björn Merker, Geoffrey Miller and Peter Todd have promoted developed versions of 
                    Darwin's theory. Other theories suggest that music was developed to assist in "coordination, 
                    cohesion and cooperation", or as part of parental care, where parents use music to increase 
                    communication with—and thus the survivability of—their children. Some commentators propose 
                    music arose alongside language, both of which supposably descend from a "shared precursor", 
                    which the composer Richard Wagner termed "speech-music".
                    <br>
                    Many cultures have their own mythical origins on the creation of music. In Chinese 
                    mythology, there are various stories, the most prominent being from the Lüshi Chunqiu 
                    which says in 2697 BCE, the musician Ling Lun—on the orders of the Yellow Emperor 
                    (Huangdi)—invented bamboo flute by imitating the song of the mythical fenghuang birds. 
                    The invention of music in Ancient Greek mythology is credited to the muses, various 
                    goddesses who were daughters of the King of the gods, Zeus; Apollo, Dionysus and Orpheus 
                    were also important musical figures for the Ancient Greeks. Persian/Iranian mythology 
                    holds that Jamshid, a legendary Shah, invented music. In Christian mythology, Jubal is 
                    called "the father of all those who play the lyre and the pipe" in Genesis 4:21, and may 
                    thus be identifiable as an originator of music for Christians. Saraswati is the god of 
                    music in Hinduism, while Väinämöinen holds a similar status as an early musical figure in 
                    Finnish folklore.
