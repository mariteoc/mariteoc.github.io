                        Rock music is a broad genre of popular music that originated as "rock and roll" in the 
                        United States in the late 1940s and early 1950s, developing into a range of different 
                        styles in the mid-1960s and later, particularly in the United States and the United Kingdom. 
                        It has its roots in 1940s and 1950s rock and roll, a style that drew directly from the blues 
                        and rhythm and blues genres of African-American music and from country music. For instrumentation, 
                        rock has centered on the electric guitar, usually as part of a rock group with electric bass, drums, 
                        and one or more singers. Like pop music, lyrics often stress romantic love but also address a wide variety 
                        of other themes that are frequently social or political.

                        Pop is a genre of popular music that originated in its modern form during the mid-1950s in the 
                        United States and the United Kingdom. The terms popular music and pop music are often used 
                        interchangeably, although the former describes all music that is popular and includes many disparate 
                        styles. During the 1950s and 1960s, pop music encompassed rock and roll and the youth-oriented styles 
                        it influenced. Rock and pop music remained roughly synonymous until the late 1960s, after which pop 
                        became associated with music that was more commercial, ephemeral, and accessible.

                        Country (also called country and western) is a genre of popular music that originated with blues, 
                        church music such as Southern gospel and spirituals, old-time, and American folk music forms including 
                        Appalachian, Cajun, Creole, and the cowboy Western music styles of New Mexico, Red Dirt, Tejano, and 
                        Texas country. Its popularized roots originate in the Southern and Southwestern United States of the 
                        early 1920s.
                        Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms, folk lyrics, and 
                        harmonies often accompanied by string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, steel 
                        guitars (such as pedal steels and dobros), and fiddles as well as harmonicas.

                        Hip hop music or hip-hop music, also known as rap music, is a genre of popular music 
                        developed in the United States by inner-city African Americans. Puerto Ricans and 
                        Jamaicans played a central role in the development of hip hop culture in the Bronx 
                        borough of New York City in the 1970s. It consists of a stylized rhythmic music that 
                        commonly accompanies rapping, a rhythmic and rhyming speech that is chanted. It 
                        developed as part of hip hop culture, a subculture defined by four key stylistic 
                        elements: MCing/rapping, DJing/scratching with turntables, break dancing, and graffiti 
                        writing. Other elements include sampling beats or bass lines from records (or synthesized 
                        beats and sounds), and rhythmic beatboxing.

                        Classical music most commonly refers to the formal musical tradition of the Western 
                        world, considered to be distinct from Western folk music or popular music traditions. 
                        Originating in Western Europe with the music of the early Christian Church, 
                        modern musicologists often classify it into major eras: the Medieval (500–1400), 
                        Renaissance (1400–1600), Baroque (1600–1750), Classical (1750–1820), Romantic (1800–1910), 
                        Modernist (1890–1975) and Postmodern/Contemporary (1950–present) eras. These periods and 
                        their dates are all approximate generalizations and represent gradual stylistic shifts that 
                        varied in intensity and prominence throughout the Western world.

                        Soul music (often referred to simply as soul) is a popular music genre that originated in the African 
                        American community throughout the United States in the 1950s and early 1960s. It combines elements of 
                        African-American gospel music, rhythm and blues and jazz. Soul music became popular for dancing and 
                        listening in the United States, where record labels such as Motown, Atlantic and Stax were influential 
                        during the Civil Rights Movement. Soul also became popular around the world, directly influencing rock 
                        music and the music of Africa.

                        Reggae (/ˈrɛɡeɪ/) is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1960s. The term also denotes the 
                        modern popular music of Jamaica and its diaspora. A 1968 single by Toots and the Maytals, "Do the Reggay" 
                        was the first popular song to use the word "reggae", effectively naming the genre and introducing it to a 
                        global audience. While sometimes used in a broad sense to refer to most types of popular Jamaican dance 
                        music, the term reggae more properly denotes a particular music style that was strongly influenced by 
                        traditional mento as well as American jazz and rhythm and blues, and evolved out of the earlier genres 
                        ska and rocksteady. Reggae usually relates news, social gossip, and political commentary.

                        Disco is a genre of dance music and a subculture that emerged in the 1970s from the United States' urban 
                        nightlife scene. Its sound is typified by four-on-the-floor beats, syncopated basslines, string sections, 
                        horns, electric piano, synthesizers, and electric rhythm guitars.
                        Disco started as a mixture of music from venues popular with Italian Americans, Hispanic and Latino 
                        Americans and African Americans, in Philadelphia and New York City during the late 1960s and early 1970s. 
                        Disco can be seen as a reaction by the 1960s counterculture to both the dominance of rock music and the 
                        stigmatization of dance music at the time. Several dance styles were developed during the period of 
                        disco's popularity in the United States, including "the Bump" and "the Hustle".

                        Gospel music is a genre of Christian music. The creation, performance, significance, 
                        and even the definition of gospel music varies according to culture and social context. 
                        Gospel music is composed and performed for many purposes, including aesthetic pleasure, 
                        religious or ceremonial purposes, and as an entertainment product for the marketplace. 
                        Gospel music often has dominant vocals (often with strong use of harmony) with Christian 
                        lyrics. Gospel music can be traced to the early 17th century.

                        Jazz is a music genre that originated in the African-American communities of New Orleans, Louisiana, 
                        United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with its roots in blues and ragtime. 
                        Since the 1920s Jazz Age, it has been recognized as a major form of musical expression in traditional 
                        and popular music, linked by the common bonds of African-American and European-American musical parentage. 
                        Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, complex chords, call and response vocals, polyrhythms 
                        and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American 
                        music traditions.

                        Rhythm and blues, often abbreviated as R&B or R'n'B, is a genre of popular music that originated in 
                        African-American communities in the 1940s. The term was originally used by record companies to describe 
                        recordings marketed predominantly to urban African Americans, at a time when "urbane, rocking, jazz based 
                        music with a heavy, insistent beat" was becoming more popular. In the commercial rhythm and blues music 
                        typical of the 1950s through the 1970s, the bands usually consisted of piano, one or two guitars, bass, 
                        drums, one or more saxophones, and sometimes background vocalists.

                        Blues is a music genre and musical form which was originated in the Deep South of the United States 
                        around the 1860s by African-Americans from roots in African-American work songs and spirituals. Blues 
                        incorporated spirituals, work songs, field hollers, shouts, chants, and rhymed simple narrative ballads. 
                        The blues form, ubiquitous in jazz, rhythm and blues and rock and roll, is characterized by the 
                        call-and-response pattern, the blues scale and specific chord progressions, of which the twelve-bar blues 
                        is the most common. Blue notes (or "worried notes"), usually thirds, fifths or sevenths flattened in pitch 
                        are also an essential part of the sound. Blues shuffles or walking bass reinforce the trance-like rhythm 
                        and form a repetitive effect known as the groove.

                        Musical theatre is a form of theatrical performance that combines songs, spoken dialogue, acting and dance. 
                        The story and emotional content of a musical – humor, pathos, love, anger – are communicated through words, 
                        music, movement and technical aspects of the entertainment as an integrated whole. Although musical 
                        theatre overlaps with other theatrical forms like opera and dance, it may be distinguished by the equal 
                        importance given to the music as compared with the dialogue, movement and other elements. Since the early 
                        20th century, musical theatre stage works have generally been called, simply, musicals.

                        Electronic music is music that employs electronic musical instruments, digital instruments, or 
                        circuitry-based music technology in its creation. It includes both music made using electronic and 
                        electromechanical means (electroacoustic music). Pure electronic instruments depended entirely on 
                        circuitry-based sound generation, for instance using devices such as an electronic oscillator, theremin, 
                        or synthesizer. Electromechanical instruments can have mechanical parts such as strings, hammers, and 
                        electric elements including magnetic pickups, power amplifiers and loudspeakers. Such electromechanical 
                        devices include the telharmonium, Hammond organ, electric piano and the electric guitar.
